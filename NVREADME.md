**TensorFlow** is an open source software library for numerical computation using
data flow graphs.  Nodes in the graph represent mathematical operations, while
the graph edges represent the multidimensional data arrays (tensors) that flow
between them.  This flexible architecture lets you deploy computation to one
or more CPUs or GPUs in a desktop, server, or mobile device without rewriting
code.  TensorFlow also includes TensorBoard, a data visualization toolkit.

TensorFlow was originally developed by researchers and engineers
working on the Google Brain team within Google's Machine Intelligence research
organization for the purposes of conducting machine learning and deep neural
networks research.  The system is general enough to be applicable in a wide
variety of other domains, as well.

**The TensorFlow team use [GitHub issues](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues)

for general questions and discussion.**

## Setup
This container has the TensorFlow Python package installed and ready to use. The
TensorFlow source code from which the library was built is also available in
`/opt/tensorflow`.

#### *Try your first TensorFlow program*
```shell
$ python
```
```python
>>> import tensorflow as tf
>>> hello = tf.constant('Hello, TensorFlow!')
>>> sess = tf.Session()
>>> sess.run(hello)
Hello, TensorFlow!
>>> a = tf.constant(10)
>>> b = tf.constant(32)
>>> sess.run(a+b)
42
>>>
```

#### Built-in examples
Examples can be run using the following commands:
```
python -m tensorflow.models.image.mnist.convolutional

python -m tensorflow.models.image.cifar10.cifar10_multi_gpu_train
```
